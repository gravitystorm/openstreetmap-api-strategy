This website describes a proposed strategy for upgrading the OpenStreetMap API version.

It's created as a standalone website, to encourage discussion and debate on the wider points of the strategy, separate from the specific code changes required to implement it. Andy originally created this site when the discussion on one pull request blew up out of all proportion.
